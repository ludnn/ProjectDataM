IT326 Data Mining Project phase 1

 Project Description:
This project focuses on analyzing housing data by classifying and clustering houses based on their prices and features such as size, number of rooms, and location. Classification will help predict the price category of a house (low, medium, or high), while clustering will group houses with similar characteristics. The main goal is to discover patterns in the housing market that are not easily visible through manual analysis.

 Motivation:
House prices are influenced by many factors, making it challenging for buyers, sellers, and real estate companies to make informed decisions. This project is motivated by the need to provide clear insights into pricing, help in market segmentation, and support decision-making in the real estate sector. It also aims to give practical experience in analyzing and interpreting real-world housing data.
